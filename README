        Spell

Spell is a simple roguelike game.  The player's goal is to capture individual 
letters and create words out of them.

Spell is a learning project for me to get more familiar with C.


        Build

Just run `make` and run `./spell` in the working directory.


        Influences

The idea for the game is inspired by Jeff Lait's Letter Hunt [1].  I also 
learned a lot by reading the code of flend's ZigClimb [2] and Jakub 
Wasilewski's A Journey To Hell [3] and Another Visit In Hell [4].  Steven 
Feurst's 512-byte roguelike [5] and the accompanying article [6] were extremely 
helpful in understanding the structure of small roguelikes.
