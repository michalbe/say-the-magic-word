        Say The Magic Word

Say The Magic Word is a simple roguelike game.  The player's goal is to capture 
individual letters and create words out of them.

Say The Magic Word is a learning project for me to get more familiar with C.


        Build

Just `make` and run `./say hello` in the working directory.  Replace `hello` 
with any other word to seed the world and the letters to collect.


        Influences

The idea for the game is inspired by Jeff Lait's Letter Hunt [1].  I also 
learned a lot by reading the code of flend's ZigClimb [2] and Jakub 
Wasilewski's A Journey To Hell [3] and Another Visit In Hell [4].  Steven 
Feurst's 512-byte roguelike [5] and the accompanying article [6] were extremely 
helpful in understanding the structure of small roguelikes.  Last but not 
least, Craig Stickel's Beginner's Guide to Roguelikes in C/C++ [7] and 
golergka's c-roguelike [8] helped me structure the code better.
